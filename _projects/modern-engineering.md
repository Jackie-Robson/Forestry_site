# Bankrate UK

After joining Red Ventures London as their only Front end developer the first project I was part of was bringing one of the Red Ventures brands to the UK. 

## What it involved

The project involved migrating the existing Bankrate UK articles from the existing platform maintained by our overseas counterpart and running the content through a static site generator which would then be pushed through to an S3 bucket.

The content was stored in a Wordpress instance and passed through to our static site generator

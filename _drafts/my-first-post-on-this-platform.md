So at Midnight on a Friday night after spending most of the day alone I decided it was time to re-vamp my personal brand (not that I had one before).

So I'm taking the first step and finally getting something onto the domain that I bought some time last year. I'm using a CMS (content management system) called forestry.io. This will allow me to write posts and  manage the static content of my site with minimum effort so I can concentrate on the important things like getting the front end nailed down and landing that first kickflip!

This is also sort of a way for me to test an alternate CMS and see if I can create a website with some meaningful content and flex my creative muscles.
